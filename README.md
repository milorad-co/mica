# Milorad Image Creation Application
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).<br>
MICA is a... "minimalist" art program that has very few features.
# How to Install
Download one of the releases - MICA.zip is for Windows, MICA.AppImage for Debian-based Linux.<br>
If you are on Windows, you should unzip MICA.zip, then start MICA.exe. If you are on Linux, you can start MICA.AppImage without any setup.<br>
If you are on MacOS, then use a different OS.
