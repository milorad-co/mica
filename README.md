# Milorad Image Creation Application
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).<br>
MICA is a... "minimalist" art program that has very few features.
# How to Install
## Windows
Download MICA-installer.exe and use it to install MICA.
## Debian-Based Linux
You can download and start MICA.AppImage without any setup.
## MacOS
You could compile from source (see below). Or you could use a different, better OS.
## Other
Bad luck, neither we nor GameMaker have support for whatever OS you are using.
# Compiling From Source
[Download and install Gamemaker if you do not have it already](https://gamemaker.io/download), open this project's YYP file, and compile it using the "Create Executable" option.
# Known Issues (Latest version)
The saving of MIF files is broken. We have no idea why, or how to fix it.
