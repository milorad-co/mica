# Milorad Image Creation Application
A very bad art program, but still better than [DuckDood's readST](https://github.com/DuckDood/readST).<br>
MICA is a... "minimalist" art program that has very few features.
# How to Install
Download one of the files from the latest release - MICA-installer.exe is for Windows, MICA.AppImage for Debian-based Linux.<br>
If you are on Windows, you should install the app with MICA-installer.exe.<br>
If you are on Linux, you can start MICA.AppImage without any setup.<br>
If you are on MacOS, then use a different OS.
# Known Issues (Latest version)
1. On Linux, MIF saving is completey broken!
2. Loading MIFs on Linux is also extremely broken.
